Analyze the effectiveness of different sales strategies, marketing campaigns, and promotions through comparative visualizations.
Identify correlations between external factors (e.g., holidays, events) and sales performance.

#### Sales Forecasting:

Gather and preprocess historic sales data, ensuring data quality and consistency.
Apply time series analysis techniques such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, or machine learning models like Prophet to generate accurate sales forecasts.
Validate and fine-tune the forecasting model using cross-validation techniques.
Generate sales forecasts for the next 15 days and visualize the predictions alongside actual sales data for evaluation.
